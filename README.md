Hello guys!!

I'm very happy to annunce one of my [reworked framework](https://github.com/lucasmcar/dmf-twitterclone-wcss). where i developed a twitter clone application.

## A little history about this

This simple framework mvc, i was learn to develop from an Udemy course in 2020, learning the basics concepts of a mvc framework structure, with routes, controllers, models and views. 
Since, his development was frozen

But, in this year, 2024, i decided rework and restructure it in a laravel based framework.
This framework was designed for the development of small and medium applications.

For now it is not available for use.
it is not recommended. Just for testing as it can and I know that there are still security flaws and some bugs to be fixed and improved over time.

So, this is the biggest personal challenge. I love programming, I love PHP. And I hope to see this framework being used in many systems too
